## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

#### Tailwind CSS

First time setting up a project using Tailwind CSS. Lessons learned:
 - Configuring and extending the installation using the config file
 - make use of Tailwind CSS utilities

#### CSS Grid

The global lay-out of page was done using CSS grid desktop makes use of 5 grid columns; ``` auto minmax(auto, 540px) auto 480px auto ``` Taking a mobile first approach the order of the columns and rows in the grid are reordered using the ```order``` attribute.

#### Dropdown menu

#### Hamburger menu

### Continued development

There are still a few todo's that require some development:
- [nice to have] intro text on desktop doesn't match designs due e.g. title, intro text
- [nice to have] list of clients width is incorrect on desktop
- [nice to have] hide mobile menu when resizing to desktop
